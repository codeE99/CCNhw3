Python Bucket Catch Game
Assignment for Computer Communication Networks. Given a game server, we were tasked to build a game with the python pygame library.
The goal is to have the falling objects fall into the object you move with the selected keys. The speed of the falling object increases as your score increases. You can retry upon a game over. To get it to work, make you sure have:
1-A version of python that works with pygame and pynum.
2-Your IP address input in the game server file. To find your IP address, open your terminal/command prompt/etc and run the ipconfig command.
